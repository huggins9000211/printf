<h6> Our goal in this project is to create our version of printf along with all of its capabilities </h6>

<h5> Holberton School students were put to the test with the task of recreating printf with specific requirements </h5>

<h2> The Function </h2>

<p> The function prototype we used consists of two paramaters: "_printf(const char *format, ...)" Here we are formatting a string that takes specific flags according to its flag... Wel get a little deeper into that later on" <p>

&ltstrong&gt #include "holberton.h"

int printf(const char *format, ...);
int index = 0;
if (format[index] == %)
{
	printf(format);
}
return(index); &lt/strong&gt
